# About Me

I find fulfillment in influencing how people work and live through innovative software solutions. This passion drives me to seek opportunities within creative and forward-thinking teams that are shaping the future. I hold a degree in Software Engineering from the University Malaysia of Computer Science and Engineering, located in the heart of Cyberjaya, Malaysiaâ€™s tech hub. My career has taken me to global cities such as Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, and currently, Dubai.

Over the past 2+ years, I have developed a strong expertise through various roles. I began as a Backend Engineer Intern at CoolRiots, where I gained comprehensive experience in web and API development, with a focus on creating microservice architecture applications. I then advanced to a DevOps and Cloud Engineer position at CoolRiots, where I utilized my knowledge in Azure and IBM Cloud to establish end-to-end DevOps processes for multiple projects. My responsibilities included:

- Managing code repositories
- Creating CI/CD pipelines
- Packaging and containerizing services with Docker
- Provisioning and managing cloud resources
- Cloud cost optimization
- Deployment management
- Advanced monitoring with Grafana, Loki, and Prometheus
- Managing and administering Kubernetes clusters using CLI, YAML files, and Terraform (including deployments, networking, and authorization)

Beyond my DevOps role, I contributed to the development of an advanced multi-tenant AI-powered business execution platform. My work involved leveraging:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Document processing
- Code generation

I maintained high-performance standards and ensured security with solutions like HashiCorp Vault.

Currently, I am working at Takaful Emarat, the market-leading individual insurance provider in the UAE. My focus is on revolutionizing the insurance industry through:

- Enhanced business automation solutions
- AI-driven customer engagement
- Uniquely personalized customer journeys
